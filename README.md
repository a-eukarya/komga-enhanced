```

**Docker Compose:**

```yaml
services:
  komga:
    image: 08shiro80/komga:latest
    container_name: komga
    network_mode: bridge
    ports:
      - "25600:25600"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config

## Why This Fork?

This fork transforms Komga from a pure media server into a **complete manga management solution**:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Manually downloading manga | **Automatic downloads** via gallery-dl — supports MangaDex and many other manga/image sites |
| Losing track of downloaded chapters | **Chapter URL tracking** — DB + filesystem checks prevent duplicates |
| Re-downloading after crashes | **Crash recovery** — auto-resumes interrupted downloads on startup |
| Title changes cause re-downloads | **UUID folder names** — MangaDex UUID as folder name, immune to title changes |
| Folder renames break series | **Series survives folder rename** — detects same series via MangaDex UUID, preserves progress and metadata |
| Unwanted chapters keep re-downloading | **Chapter blacklist** — permanent + auto-detection of same-group duplicates and dead-link redirects |
| Syncing MangaDex subscriptions | **MangaDex Subscription Sync** — auto-downloads from your followed manga feed |
| Source upload uses wrong chapter number | **Add-Chapter-Download** — paste a chapter URL with custom filename + number override |
| Cloudflare blocks the source site | **FlareSolverr integration** — transparent challenge-bypass for non-MangaDex sources |
| Missing metadata | **MangaDex, AniList, Kitsu & Metron plugins** for rich metadata |
| Manual metadata-match per series | **Auto Metadata Match** — title-similarity scoring across providers on scan |
| Tracker progress out of sync | **Manga Scrobbler** — AniList / MyAnimeList / Kitsu / MangaDex on book completion |
| Western comics need their own tracker | **Comic Scrobbler** — Metron |
| Migrating from Tachiyomi/Mihon | **Backup import** extracts your MangaDex follows |
| No guest browsing for family | **Guest/Kiosk mode** — read-only browsing without login, per-library access control |
| Long vertical webtoon pages | **Page splitting** like TachiyomiSY |
| Corrupt CBZ after an interrupted write | **CbzSafeWriter** — every CBZ-mutating path writes through a single hardened pipeline with multi-stage verify + atomic rollback |
| Silent CBZ corruption goes unnoticed | **Media Integrity Verify / Repair / Rescan** — byte-wise scan, `zip -FF`-based repair, persistent ERROR-flag in the UI |
| Long-running maintenance hidden | **Background-job indicator** in the nav-bar — Verify / Repair / Split-All / Re-inject all visible from anywhere |
| No server logs in UI | **Web-based log viewer** — real-time SSE, persistent log-level, dual Debug/Info toggle |
| One-off DB/CBZ maintenance | **Settings → Fixes** page — GUI-triggered re-inject of ComicInfo.xml across a library |
| Bland default theme | **7 color themes** — AMOLED, Nord, Dracula, Solarized, Green, Red + Default |

## Features

Grouped by area. Every section here is implemented and shipped; nothing aspirational.

### Downloads & Automation

#### Download System

Download manga from MangaDex and other manga/image sites via [gallery-dl-komga](https://github.com/08shiro80/gallery-dl-komga) (a fork of [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl) with Komga-specific enhancements):

- **Queue-based downloads** with priority support
- **Real-time progress** via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **ComicInfo.xml injection** — metadata embedded in every CBZ
- **UUID folder names** — uses MangaDex UUID as folder name, immune to title changes and mislabeled titles
- **Crash recovery** — skips already-downloaded chapters via DB + filesystem checks, auto-resumes interrupted downloads on restart
- **Auto-retry** — failed downloads are retried with backoff; after 3 consecutive failures the chapter URL is auto-blacklisted so the queue keeps moving
- **Repair ComicInfo** — retroactively inject missing ComicInfo.xml and ZIP comments into existing MangaDex CBZ files (skips non-MangaDex sources to avoid destroying source-specific metadata)
- **Rate limiting** — respects site-specific API limits
- **Multi-language support** — 36 languages, shared across all plugins (one setting)
- **Automatic publisher detection** — derives publisher from source site (MangaDex, Mangahere, etc.)
- **Custom gallery-dl path** — point to a local gallery-dl-komga checkout for latest extractors

Any manga/image URL supported by gallery-dl works — not just MangaDex. Simply paste the URL in the WebUI to start a download.

#### MangaDex Subscription Feed Sync

Automatically sync new chapters from your MangaDex subscription feed — completely independent from the follow.txt system:

1. Create a [MangaDex API Client](https://mangadex.org/settings) (Personal Client)
2. Enable the `mangadex-subscription` plugin in **Settings → Plugins**
3. Enter your `client_id`, `client_secret`, `username`, and `password`
4. The syncer authenticates via OAuth2 and polls your follow feed

**How it works:**
- Authenticates with MangaDex via OAuth2 (password grant through Keycloak)
- Checks `GET /user/follows/manga` for newly followed manga → queues full download
- Checks `GET /user/follows/manga/feed?publishAtSince=...` for new chapters of existing manga, with a 30-min look-back window so chapters whose feed-indexing lagged the sync boundary still land
- Pre-checks each new manga for downloadable English chapters before queuing — dead-manga (only external-redirect or empty pages) are skipped without being permanently blacklisted (re-evaluated on every sync in case en-chapters appear later)
- Deduplicates against DB: checks mangaDexUuid → series → CHAPTER_URL IDs and blacklist before queuing
- Filters by the language configured in the gallery-dl Downloader plugin (`Default Language`)
- Resilient to temporary MangaDex API failures (retries on next scheduled check)

**Configuration** (via Plugin Manager UI):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `client_id` | — | MangaDex API Client ID |
| `client_secret` | — | MangaDex API Client Secret |
| `username` | — | MangaDex username |
| `password` | — | MangaDex password |
| `sync_interval_minutes` | 30 | How often to check for new chapters |

**No app restart needed** — the syncer automatically restarts when you save config or toggle the plugin.

#### Follow List Automation

Automatically check for new chapters from your favorite manga:

1. Create a `follow.txt` file in your library root
2. Add URLs (one per line) — MangaDex URLs get fast aggregate checking, other sites use gallery-dl
3. Configure check interval (default: 24 hours)
4. Fast parallel checking via MangaDex aggregate API (~200 manga in 2 minutes)
5. New chapters download automatically

```
# Example follow.txt
https://mangadex.org/title/a1c7c817-4e59-43b7-9365-09c5f56e5eb1
https://mangadex.org/title/32d76d19-8a05-4db0-9fc2-e0b0648fe9d0
https://mangahere.cc/manga/one_piece/
https://manhuaplus.com/manga/magic-emperor/
https://hdoujin.me/12345
```

#### Add-Chapter-Download (per series)

For series whose source uploads arrive as one-off chapters that don't fit the rest of the series naming, the **`Add Chapter Download…`** entry in the 3-dot menu of a series opens a dialog with two modes:

- **Single Chapter** — paste a chapter URL, optionally override `Filename`, `Chapter #`, `Volume`, `Chapter Title`. With overrides on, the downloaded CBZ is renamed and `<Number>` / `<Volume>` / `<Title>` are upserted into ComicInfo so it sorts correctly in the series.
- **Series + Range** — paste a manga URL with a chapter-range filter (e.g. `chapter>=50,chapter<=80`), runs gallery-dl with the filter expression. Standard naming applies.

`Skip if file exists` compares **DB chapter numbers** (`BookMetadata.numberSort`), not filenames — filenames vary too much per source. The destination is taken from the series the menu was triggered on, so an Add-Chapter-Download into an existing UUID folder never creates a parallel manga folder.

#### Cloudflare Bypass (FlareSolverr)

Cloudflare-protected manga sites (mgeko.cc, mangaclash.com, deatte5.com, tritinia.org, manhwatop.com, …) cannot be fetched by gallery-dl's `requests` session — the server returns the Cloudflare challenge HTML.

The companion gallery-dl-komga fork supports an external [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) endpoint that solves the challenge in headless Chrome and returns the cookies + User-Agent that solved it. Per-host cookies + UA are cached on disk for 20 minutes — subsequent runs go direct without re-invoking FlareSolverr. The challenge round-trip only fires on a Cloudflare HTML response or a cold cache; JSON-API endpoints (`api.mangadex.org`) stay on the direct path.

Set `flaresolverr_url` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8191/v1`) in **Plugin Manager → gallery-dl Downloader**. Leave blank to disable.

#### MangaDex Search on Downloads Page

A prominent search card sits at the top of **Downloads**. Pick a target library once from the dropdown, then for each result you get two buttons:

- **Download** — queues a one-time download into the selected library
- **Follow / Following** — a toggle. If the title isn't in any library's `follow.txt`, the button is "Follow" and appends the MangaDex URL to the selected library. If it's already in any library's `follow.txt`, the button is "Following" (success-coloured) and a second click removes the line from whichever library contains it.

**Advanced filters** (collapsible panel) — multi-select for:
- *Include tags / genres* (MangaDex `includedTags[]`)
- *Blacklist tags / genres* (MangaDex `excludedTags[]`) — useful for permanently hiding things you never want to see
- Status (ongoing / completed / hiatus / cancelled)
- Content rating (default = all four — empty selection keeps it that way)
- Publication demographic (shounen / shoujo / seinen / josei / none)
- *Only titles with downloadable chapters* (toggle) — MangaDex' built-in `hasAvailableChapters=true` is too generous (it counts external-link chapters and 0-page placeholders as "available", e.g. Solo Leveling still shows up even though every English chapter just links to webnovel.com). With this toggle on the UI does one extra `/manga/{id}/feed` call per result and only keeps titles where at least one chapter has `externalUrl == null` AND `pages > 0` in your preferred language (read from gallery-dl Downloader `default_language`). Each result is cached server-side for 24h.

  > **Cost:** 1 extra MangaDex API call per result when the toggle is on (cached). 20 results = ~20 extra calls = a few seconds of throttling on first run, then free until cache expires. Toggle off = zero extra cost.

With no title and at least one filter set, the button switches to **Browse** and queries MangaDex sorted by `followedCount desc` — popular-first browse when you can't decide what to read next.

**Pagination** — 24 results per page, classic page selector below the grid. MangaDex caps `offset + limit ≤ 10000`, so the page count tops out at 417 pages with the default page size.

**Tag catalog cached 7 days in your browser** — the tag dropdown is filled from `GET /api/v1/plugins/mangadex-metadata/tags` on first use, then served from `localStorage` for a week (MangaDex updates its tags only a few times a year). No tag fetch on every page load.

**Persistent defaults** — a **Save as default** button writes the current filter combination to your **Komga account** (user client-setting `komga.fork.mangadexsearch.defaults`), so defaults follow you across browsers and devices (a previously saved per-browser `localStorage` value is migrated automatically). On the next visit the panel pre-fills with those values, so you can set a permanent tag blacklist once and forget about it. **Clear all** resets the current selection without touching the saved default.

**Already-followed titles are marked** — on page load the search card pre-fetches every library's `follow.txt`, extracts the MangaDex UUIDs, and uses that set to flip every result's Follow button to "Following" state. No special filter; just an honest two-state toggle.

> **API rate-limit note:** every search and browse call goes through `MangaDexMetadataPlugin` to `api.mangadex.org` and counts against MangaDex's global rate limit (~5 req/sec). Heavy use of the panel — especially Browse — will throttle (HTTP 429) for a few seconds, same as the rest of the fork's MangaDex traffic.

#### Tachiyomi/Mihon Migration

Import your manga library from Tachiyomi or Mihon:

- Supports `.tachibk` (Mihon/forks) and `.proto.gz` (Tachiyomi) formats
- Extracts MangaDex URLs from your backup
- Adds URLs to your library's `follow.txt`
- Duplicate detection prevents re-adding existing URLs

#### Chapter Blacklist

Permanently prevent unwanted chapters from being re-downloaded:

- **Blacklist & Delete** via book 3-dot menu — blacklists the chapter URL and deletes the book file
- **Manage Blacklist** via series 3-dot menu — view, remove, and **manually add** blacklisted chapter URLs
- **Manual URL entry** — paste MangaDex chapter URLs directly into the blacklist dialog for edge cases the automatic system can't handle
- Persists even after book deletion (stored in separate database table)
- Respected by both the downloader and chapter checker

**Three automatic blacklist paths** keep the queue self-cleaning:

- **Same-group duplicates** — when a scanlation group uploads the same chapter multiple times on MangaDex (same chapter number, same group, different UUIDs), the system keeps the newest upload and blacklists the older duplicates
- **External-redirect chapters** — MangaDex chapters with `externalUrl != null && pages == 0` (J-Novel-style redirects to a publisher site) are blacklisted on detection — they can't be downloaded anyway
- **Three-strikes** — chapters that fail download three times in a row are auto-blacklisted so the queue keeps moving instead of hammering the same broken URL

All three log at WARN so the operator can review and remove individual entries via the series blacklist dialog if needed.

#### Chapter URL Tracking

Never download the same chapter twice:

- Database tracking of all downloaded chapter URLs
- Filesystem duplicate detection via existing CBZ files
- Tracks chapter metadata (volume, language, scanlation group)
- Multi-group support — same chapter from different scanlation groups downloaded separately

> **Important:** `Import chapter URLs` is **enabled by default** and required for the downloader, follow list, and subscription sync to detect already-downloaded chapters. **Disable it** in **Library → Edit → Metadata** for libraries that don't use the download system — otherwise library scans will be significantly slower.

### Metadata & Trackers

#### Enhanced Metadata

Rich metadata from multiple sources:

**MangaDex Metadata Plugin:**
- Fetches title, description, authors, artists
- Multi-language title support (10+ languages)
- Genre and tag mapping
- Cover art downloading

**AniList Metadata Plugin:**
- GraphQL-based metadata fetching
- Configurable title preference (English/Romaji/Native)
- Detailed series information

**Kitsu Metadata Plugin** *(ships as a default external plugin — see [Custom Plugins](#custom-plugins-external-jars)):*
- Fetches title, synopsis, authors, genres, age rating
- Alternative titles in multiple languages
- Cover art downloading
- No API key required

**Metron Metadata Plugin** *(disabled by default — comic metadata):*
- Fetches comic series metadata from [metron.cloud](https://metron.cloud) (free account required)
- Title, publisher, description, genres, cover art
- For Western comics where MangaDex/AniList don't apply

#### Auto Metadata Match

Komf-style automatic provider matching for new series on scan:

- Walks a configured provider priority (`anilist,mangadex,kitsu` by default)
- Scores candidates by normalized-title Jaccard similarity (default threshold `0.85`)
- Writes a `web_url` plus multi-source `tracker_links` into `series.json`, so `MylarSeriesProvider` produces one WebLink per matched site
- Bulk-match existing series: `POST /api/v1/automatch/libraries/{id}`
- Configured via `Plugin Manager → Auto Metadata Match` with a **GUI** (drag-free ordered provider list + library multi-select) instead of raw CSV; **does not** appear in the per-series *Search Online Databases* dialog (it runs as a background processor, not a manual search provider)
- Works with **external metadata plugins** too — any installed `MetadataProviderPlugin` becomes selectable in the provider priority

#### Tracker Sync (Scrobblers)

Push read progress to external trackers when a book is marked completed:

**Manga Scrobbler** — AniList / MyAnimeList / Kitsu / MangaDex:
- OAuth2 auto-refresh for MAL and Kitsu tokens
- Tracker IDs auto-detected from `SeriesMetadata.links` (anilist.co, myanimelist.net, kitsu.app, mangadex.org), or via manual JSON mappings
- Per-user filtering (`sync_user_id`) and per-library exclusion (`exclude_library_ids`)

**Comic Scrobbler** — Metron:
- Pushes Western comic issue progress to metron.cloud
- Resolves issue IDs from `metron.cloud/issue/…` and `metron.cloud/series/…` links

Both scrobblers persist last-known progress and status per (series, tracker) in a `sync_state` table so duplicate submissions are skipped after restarts.

#### Shared MangaDex Credentials

`gallery-dl Downloader` is the single source of truth for MangaDex authentication. Set `mangadex_username` / `mangadex_password` / `mangadex_client_id` / `mangadex_client_secret` once on that plugin and **MangaDex Subscription Sync** + **Manga Scrobbler** read from it automatically (their own equivalent fields stay empty and only act as per-plugin overrides). The Subscription Sync's `default_language` is already read this way today (in `MangaDexSubscriptionSyncer.checkFeed`), and the credential reads follow the same pattern.

Resolution order for each MangaDex field:
1. The consuming plugin's own field (if non-blank)
2. `gallery-dl Downloader` (`mangadex_*`)
3. `MangaDex Subscription Sync` (`client_id`/`client_secret`/`username`/`password`) — second fallback for the scrobbler only

#### Custom Plugins (External JARs)

Beyond the built-in plugins, the fork can **load external plugin JARs at runtime** — drop them into `<config-dir>/plugins/` or upload via **Plugin Manager → Install Plugin** (file or URL). Built-in plugins stay compiled in and **cannot be uninstalled**; only external plugins are removable.

> **Docker:** the plugins folder lives at `/config/plugins`, which is **already inside the mounted `/config` volume** — no extra volume mount is needed. Drop JARs there (or upload via the UI) and they persist across container restarts. The bundled default plugins (e.g. Kitsu) are auto-installed there on first start.

- **Two plugin types today:** `MetadataProviderPlugin` (search + metadata, shows up in *Search Online Databases* and Auto Metadata Match) and `NotifierPlugin` (receives `DOWNLOAD_COMPLETED` / `DOWNLOAD_FAILED` events — webhook, Discord, …)
- **Class-loader isolation (SPI-only)** — each JAR runs under a `SpiOnlyClassLoader` whose parent whitelists only the SPI (`org.gotson.komga.infrastructure.plugin.api.*`), JDK (`java.*`/`javax.*`), Kotlin runtime (`kotlin.*`/`kotlinx.*`) and Jackson (`com.fasterxml.jackson.*`). A plugin attempting `import org.gotson.komga.domain.…` or Spring gets `ClassNotFoundException("Plugin denied access to '…' — class-loader isolation. …")`. Bundle anything else you need (OkHttp, JDBC driver, …) into your plugin JAR. Load failures never crash the server.
- **Default external plugin:** the **Kitsu** provider is shipped this way (bundled in the app, auto-installed on first start) as the reference implementation
- **Write your own:** copy [`plugins/plugin-template`](plugins/plugin-template), edit one Kotlin file, run `./gradlew build`, install the JAR. Full guide: **[PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md)**

> **Security model — class-loader isolation, NOT a sandbox.** The whitelist above blocks compile-time/runtime imports of Komga internals so a plugin can't reach into the host through the SPI's back door. It does **not** restrict filesystem (`java.io.File`), network (`java.net.http`) or reflection (`java.lang.reflect`) — those are intentionally allowed because plugins call external APIs. An installed external JAR runs arbitrary code with the same OS rights as the Komga process. The install endpoint is admin-only — only install plugins you trust. See [PLUGINS.md → Security model](PLUGINS.md#security-model) for the full statement of limits.

### Reading & Browsing

#### Tall Page Splitting

Split long vertical webtoon pages into readable segments:

- Configurable maximum height threshold
- Batch processing for entire libraries with **active UI filter respected** — Split-All only walks the books matching the visible filter, not the whole library
- Endpoint-level lock prevents double-click fan-out
- Per-book serialisation + global parallelism cap (max 2 simultaneous splits) — webtoon pages can be 180 MB BufferedImages each, the cap keeps the JVM from OOMing
- Preserves original files via `CbzSafeWriter` (see [Reliability](#reliability--data-safety))
- Similar to TachiyomiSY's "split tall images" feature

#### Guest/Kiosk Mode

Read-only browsing without login — perfect for family or shared setups:

- Toggle in admin **Settings → UI**
- "Als Gast durchsuchen" button on login page
- Per-library guest access — admins select which libraries are visible
- Security: GET-only access to series/books/libraries, admin routes blocked

#### Color Themes

7 predefined theme presets in **Account → UI Settings**:

- Default, AMOLED, Nord, Dracula, Solarized, Green, Red
- Each preset defines both light and dark mode colors
- Persistent selection via browser local storage

#### Configurable Folder Naming

Choose how new manga folders are named:

- `uuid` (default) — uses MangaDex UUID like `0c6fe779-...`
- `title` — uses manga title like `Roman Club`
- Set in **Plugin Manager → gallery-dl Downloader** settings
- Only affects new manga — existing folders are never renamed

#### Configurable Chapter Naming

Override the gallery-dl `directory` template per-install via the **Plugin Manager → gallery-dl Downloader → Chapter Naming Template** field. Blank keeps each site's default. Common fields: `{chapter}`, `{chapter_minor}`, `{volume}`, `{title}`, `{group}`, `{lang}`.

`ChapterMatcher` accepts three prefix shapes in the resulting filename for post-download CBZ matching and resume detection: **`c<num>`** (gallery-dl default — e.g. `c001`), **`ch. <num>`** (e.g. `ch. 1`), or **`Chapter <num>`** / **`Chapter_<num>`** (e.g. `Chapter 1`, `Chapter_001`). Letter suffixes (`5.5a`, `5.5b` — MangaDex convention for split releases of the same decimal chapter) are preserved across both extraction and matching. Pick any template that produces one of these three prefixes; the rest of the filename is yours.

### Reliability & Data Safety

The fork puts the same level of care into not-corrupting-your-library as it does into the user-visible features. Many of these are silent in normal operation — you only notice them when something would have gone wrong.

#### CbzSafeWriter — every CBZ-mutating path

Six paths can mutate a CBZ on disk (`PageSplitter`, `BookPageEditor.removeHashedPages` / `deletePages`, `ComicInfoGenerator.writeInjected` / `injectComicInfoWithRetry`, `DownloadExecutor.patchComicInfo`). All six route through one utility that guarantees:

- **Pre-flight disk-space check** — refuses if free space < 2× expected output size
- **Hybrid RAM/disk build** — < 100 MB original = in-RAM build, ≥ 100 MB = direct disk-tmp (avoids OOM on webtoon CBZs while keeping the fast path RAM-only for typical chapters)
- **Three independent verify passes** — in-RAM ZipInputStream, post-write ZipFile open + byte-read, post-rename ZipFile open. An SMB-truncated write or partial rename is caught before the original is touched.
- **Backup-via-move (not copy)** — original.cbz → `.bak.<uuid>` only after the new bytes are verified on disk; the backup move + atomic rename are the only window where the file isn't readable. At 150-chapter Split-All on a 50-200 MB-per-chapter library this saves ~15-30 GB of disk traffic per run versus a copy-based approach.
- **Atomic rollback on any failure** — `.bak` is moved back over `target`; rollback failure leaves `.bak` on disk and a fatal-level log line gives its path so the user can restore manually.

The lambda signature is `(OutputStream) -> Unit` so callers can wrap the stream in either `java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream` or Apache commons-compress `ZipArchiveOutputStream` — same writer, both ZIP APIs.

#### Media Integrity — Verify / Repair / Rescan

`Settings → Maintenance → Verify ZIP integrity` runs a byte-wise check over every `.cbz` / `.zip` in the library:

- **Two-pass read with a 2s sleep between passes** — only flags after **both** passes fail. Transient I/O errors (HDD bad-sector retry, file-handle race against a concurrent write) don't produce false positives.
- **Persistent ERROR-flag** — corrupt books get `Media.Status.ERROR` with a `Corrupt CBZ: <message>` comment, surface in the analysis filter, and survive container restart (count comes from `mediaRepository.countByStatus(ERROR)` when no scan is running)
- **`Repair flagged`** runs `zip -FF <src> --out <tmp>` per ERROR-book. Fully recovered → `Files.move` overwrites + status flips to `OUTDATED` for re-analyze. Partial → comment updated, status stays ERROR.
- **`Rescan flagged`** byte-wise re-verifies each ERROR-book and only emits `taskEmitter.analyzeBook` for those that pass. Use after a Repair-Partial or after fixing files externally.

#### Background-Job Indicator

The task-count indicator in the nav-bar now reflects custom long-running actions too — `Split-All`, `Verify Integrity`, `Repair`, `Re-inject ComicInfo`, library imports. The tooltip lists active job names. You can navigate away from the originating page without losing visibility.

#### SQLite Hardening

Default SQLite was tuned for embedded single-user use. The fork picks values that match a multi-tab Komga UI against a library DB measured in hundreds of MB:

- **`busy-timeout: 30s`** (both DBs) — the JDBC driver waits transparently instead of bubbling `SQLITE_BUSY` to the task layer
- **`synchronous: NORMAL`** (both DBs) — fsync only at WAL-checkpoint boundaries, 3-5× faster on bulk writes; no corruption risk under WAL, ~1 s commits may be lost on power-cut
- **`cache_size: 2000`** (main DB only — `tasks-db` is small) — 8 MB per connection (default is 2 MB) holds the working set of the dominant indexes
- **Dynamic RO pool** — mirrors `/settings/server → Task threads` (upstream historically capped to 1 from pre-WAL days). Resizes live without restart.
- **`SQLITE_BUSY` retry-loop in `TaskHandler`** — 5 attempts with linear backoff (500 ms → 2.5 s) catches the edge case where a write enters busy state right at the 30 s ceiling

#### Database Hygiene

Two scheduled jobs run daily and prune log/event tables to keep the SQLite file lean:

- `PLUGIN_LOG` — entries older than 7 days are deleted (was unbounded; observed 119k+ rows on installs without retention)
- `HISTORICAL_EVENT` + `HISTORICAL_EVENT_PROPERTIES` — pruned together (the schema has no `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so the DAO deletes properties first then events)

> **Note on file size:** SQLite does **not** shrink `database.sqlite` when rows are deleted — freed pages are reused for future writes but the file stays the same size on disk (it just stops growing). To actually reclaim space, run `VACUUM;` against the database (e.g. `sqlite3 database.sqlite "VACUUM;"`) — this works while Komga is running but holds a brief exclusive lock. Retention prevents unbounded growth; VACUUM is the one-time reclaim.

#### Auto-Scan After Download

New chapters are automatically scanned after a download completes (`scanDeep=false` — filesystem walk only, cheap):

- Triggered only when `newlyDownloaded > 0` (resume runs that found nothing already on disk are skipped)
- New books are added, analyzed, and chapter URLs imported automatically
- No full library scan needed; no waiting for the next scheduled scan

### Admin & Maintenance

#### Settings → Fixes

GUI-triggered one-time maintenance actions under **Settings → Fixes**. Cards are versioned and removed once obsolete. The card list is built dynamically from `FixRegistry` — adding a new fix is one block of Kotlin + one backend endpoint, no frontend change.

- **Re-inject ComicInfo.xml** — regenerates `ComicInfo.xml` + `series.json` for every CBZ in the selected library from MangaDex metadata. Enable *Force* to overwrite existing ComicInfo (useful when MangaDex metadata changed). **CBZs from non-MangaDex sources are skipped even under Force** — the re-inject reads the existing `<Web>` tag and refuses to overwrite mangabuddy / cubari / Mihon-export ComicInfo with MangaDex metadata. Image entries are written with `STORED` to skip re-deflating already-compressed data (~3-5× faster sweep).

#### Web Log Viewer

Admin-only log viewer in **Settings → Logs**:

- **Live streaming** via SSE — real-time log tailing without polling
- **Pause/Resume** — buffer incoming logs while paused, flush on resume
- **Persistent log level** — switch between DEBUG / INFO / WARN at runtime via two mutually-exclusive toggles (Debug, Info; both off = WARN). The choice persists in the DB and is re-applied on restart.
- Color-coded log levels (ERROR=red, WARN=orange, DEBUG=grey)
- Client-side search/filter
- Full log file download

The fork pins `org.gotson.komga: WARN` as the baseline log level — state-altering events (auto-blacklist, stale-recovery, repair-skip, etc.) are emitted at WARN so they survive the default install. Routine flow stays at INFO/DEBUG and only surfaces when you flip the toggle.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Java 21+
- [gallery-dl-komga](https://github.com/08shiro80/gallery-dl-komga) (`pip install https://github.com/08shiro80/gallery-dl-komga/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz`)
- (Optional) [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) endpoint for Cloudflare-protected sources

### Docker

See [Quick Start](#quick-start) for Docker and Docker Compose commands. The Docker image already contains gallery-dl-komga, kepubify, and `zip` (for the Repair path); no extra setup needed.

### Updating gallery-dl-komga in Docker

gallery-dl-komga is installed via pip inside the Docker image. The fork keeps the upstream version string (`1.32.1`), so a plain `-U` will **not** pull in new commits — pip sees an unchanged version and reuses its cached wheel, and GitHub caches the branch tarball for a few minutes. Force a clean reinstall:

```bash
docker exec -u 0 komga pip3 install --break-system-packages --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall \
  https://github.com/08shiro80/gallery-dl-komga/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz
```

To pin an exact commit — immutable, and it bypasses the branch-tarball cache entirely — use its SHA instead of `refs/heads/master`:

```bash
docker exec -u 0 komga pip3 install --break-system-packages --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall \
  https://github.com/08shiro80/gallery-dl-komga/archive/<commit-sha>.tar.gz
```

gallery-dl runs as a subprocess per download, so no Komga restart is needed — the next download uses the updated version.

### JAR

```bash
java -jar komga.jar
```

> Install **[gallery-dl-komga](https://github.com/08shiro80/gallery-dl-komga)** (the fork, see [Requirements](#requirements)) — the download/ComicInfo features rely on the fork's `komga` postprocessor, not upstream PyPI `gallery-dl`. Point the gallery-dl Downloader plugin's `gallery_dl_path` at a local checkout if needed.

### Important: Metadata Completeness

Full metadata in ComicInfo.xml and series.json (title, authors, genres, cover art, publish dates, scanlation group, etc.) is only guaranteed when downloading from **MangaDex** or when using the **MangaDex/AniList metadata plugins**. Other sites supported by gallery-dl will download chapters correctly, but metadata may be incomplete or missing.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Build frontend
cd komga-webui && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Build backend with frontend
./gradlew prepareThymeLeaf :komga:bootJar

# Run
java -jar komga/build/libs/komga-*.jar
```

---

## Configuration

### gallery-dl Setup

Create `~/.config/gallery-dl/config.json`:

```json
{
  "extractor": {
    "mangadex": {
      "lang": ["en"],
      "chapter-filter": "lang == 'en'"
    }
  }
}
```

To use a local gallery-dl-komga checkout (e.g. for latest extractors), set `gallery_dl_path` in the plugin config to the directory containing the `gallery_dl` package. This sets `PYTHONPATH` so `python -m gallery_dl` loads from your local source.

### FlareSolverr

If you have a FlareSolverr instance for Cloudflare-protected sites, set its URL in **Plugin Manager → gallery-dl Downloader → `flaresolverr_url`** (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8191/v1`). Blank disables the feature.

### Follow List Check Interval

Configure via application properties:

```yaml
komga:
  download:
    follow-check-interval: 24h
```

## Switching Between Official Komga and This Fork

The fork stores its database migrations in a separate history table (`flyway_fork_history`), completely independent from the official Komga migration history (`flyway_schema_history`):

- **Official Komga → Fork:** Works. Fork migrations run automatically on first startup.
- **Fork → Official Komga:** Works. Official Komga only sees its own migration history and starts normally. The fork's extra tables and columns remain in the database but are ignored.
